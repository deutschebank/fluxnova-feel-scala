Since Fluxnova has 11 days to reach the Con, Fluxnova decides to stay a bit longer in Cologne. :de: For
the last trip, Fluxnova wants to take a train :bullettrain_front: to Berlin.

On the train schedule, there is a special train that leaves Cologne on each Monday morning. Fluxnova
looks at the calendar but is unsure about the current weekday.

Can you help him? Use
[temporal functions] to resolve the current weekday.

<LiveFeel
  defaultExpression={dedent`
    // use a function to get the weekday of the current date
    date(targetDate)`}
    feelContext='{"targetDate": "2022-10-05", "remainingTime": "P11D"}'
  metadata={{ page: "tutorial-3-2" }}
