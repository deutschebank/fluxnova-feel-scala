The tutorial is created as part of our Fluxnova Summer Hack Days project 2022.

It may be incomplete, wrong, or broken. But stay tuned for updates!

Welcome to our tutorial. :wave:

We'll do our best to guide you through the different capabilities
of [FEEL](https://docs.fluxnova.finos.org/user-guide/dmn-engine/feel/) and hopefully make the
process fun. :tada:

We are enlisting you to help us guide our friend "Fluxnova" to complete a quest from Spain :es: to Berlin
:de: in time for Con (2022). With the use of FEEL we'll be able to help in the journey.

Before we start, let's say "Hi" to Fluxnova:

![Zee](/img/zee.png)

Use the interactive editor below to evaluate the
[FEEL expression](https://docs.fluxnova.finos.org/user-guide/dmn-engine/expressions-and-scripts/) and greet Fluxnova.

<LiveFeel
    defaultExpression={dedent`
    "Hello Fluxnova"
    `}
    metadata={{ page: "tutorial-the-quest-begins" }}
/>

:::note
FEEL is an expression language. Compared to script languages or other complex programming
languages, an expression language evaluates only a single expression.

Fluxnova is happy to have you on board. So, let the journey begin. :rocket:
