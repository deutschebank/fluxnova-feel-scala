Welcome to the documentation of the FEEL-Scala engine!

If you're **new** and don't know anything about FEEL then have a look
at [What is FEEL](https://docs.fluxnova.finos.org/user-guide/dmn-engine/feel/) first.

If you want to know how to **write** FEEL expressions then have a look at
the following pages of the language guide:
- [Data types](https://docs.fluxnova.finos.org/user-guide/dmn-engine/data-types/)
- [Expressions](https://docs.fluxnova.finos.org/user-guide/dmn-engine/expressions-and-scripts/)
- [Unary-tests](https://docs.fluxnova.finos.org/user-guide/dmn-engine/testing/)

If you want to **integrate** the FEEL engine in your application then have a look at
the [Developer Guide](/docs/developer-guide/).

If you want to **try out** your FEEL expressions in development then check out the
[Playground](/playground/playground.mdx) (online or local).
